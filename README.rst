Bob's 40th Birthday Extravaganza
================================

So I'm turning 40 in September and it seems like a perfect excuse to go to Vegas!
I hope we can find a hotel and a weekend that works for everyone. If you want to
invite other people please feel free. Here are the details:

:Dates: September 19th - 21st
:Location: `Golden Nugget`_ (downtown vegas)

Hotel
=====

The famous `Golden Nugget`_ in downtown vegas. They have a really good Sports book for the sunday games and
is on the Fremont Street experience. So we can hop around to the various casinos to get our craps and blackjack
on. They also have a kick ass pool if we get tired of all the gaming.

Schedule
========

Saturday arrival (9:30am):
    Use the Golden Nugget shuttle_ $18 round trip.

Saturday Day:
    Much drinking and gaming in the Downtown (there is also an abc_ store right next to the nugget that sells liquor)

Saturday Night:
    Rent a limo to go to the strip. 8 person limo is about $75/hour. We can also schedule it to bring us back to the nugget, but I'm fine with just arriving in style at the Bellagio and cabbing it back.

Sunday Day:
    Football at the sportsbook and/or hit the pool

Sunday Night:
    Shenanigans in downtown

Monday:
    Sober up and leave

Food/Drink Ideas
================

* `Heart attack grill`_
* `Oak and Ivy`_

Flights
=======

Flights aren't looking too bad there are a few direct flights and many with
one stop for less. It would be great if we can all try to show up at the same
time. I'm leaning towards the 940 arrival as it gives more time to setup for
the night.

Southwest AUS to LAS Sept 19th
    * 1279  820am - 940am : $193
    * 2954  205pm - 300pm : $193

Southwest LAS to AUS Sept 21st
